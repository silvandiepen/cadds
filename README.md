CADDS or Config and Data Driven Styling is a styling methodology based on styling a complete project from one single config file. It might sound odd, but it's possible without making it too complicated.


### Why?
The idea is to create a config file which holds all the styling for a project. By including this file into another with some different defaults, you can completely alter the outcome and create themes.


## How?

To use the CADDS styling you need to make sure your project has a few things in stock; Knowledge of the CSS cascade, BEM and install CaDDS and Sass in your project.

```npm install cadds sass```
